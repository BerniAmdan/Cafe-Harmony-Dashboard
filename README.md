# Cafe-Harmony-Operations and Customer Analysis (Interactive Dashboard created using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
The Cafe has experienced rapid growth and now faces the challenges of improving its overall operational efficiency and customer experience. The company wants to address this issue by analyzing the 2014-2016 dataset to gain insight for further decision-making.

## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/BerniAmdan/baanalytics.github.io/blob/main/Cafe_Harmony_Capstone_Project%20Data%20set%20%26%20Analysis.xlsm">Dataset</a>

## Questions addressed
- Which menu items are performing the best across different locations?
- What is the customer profile that tends to spend the most(age, gender, or preferred product)?
- How can the café improve its stock management to avoid running out of popular items while also reducing overstocking?
- Are there any locations or employee performance issues that require attention?

- Formulas like Vlookup, Index/Match, and Text according to the dataset
- Used DAX measures to calculate the number of transactions, total sales, and quantity sold.
- Used PIVOT tables to summarise, analyse, explore, and present data quickly and interactively.
- Used PIVOT tables to summarise, analyse, explore, and present data quickly and interactively.

## Project Insight
- Muffin, Cappuccino, and Iced Tea were the overall top-3 performers, contributing 55% of the total sales for the 3 years under review.
- Overall monthly sales peaked in August and trolled in November, while individual locations over the years showed varying patterns of sales.

## Recommendations
- Focus marketing & promoting top performers: Allocating more marketing budget to promote combo deals or loyalty programs featuring items like muffin and Cappuccino.
- Optimize inventory for top-sellers: With a 55% combined contribution, Muffin, Cappuccino, and Iced Tea must have priority in stock management.
- Seasonal or targeted promotion: Consider seasonal marketing campaigns (e.g, summer promotions) for Iced Tea because of fluctuations in ranking.
- Leveraging female buying power: Run promotions or bundles specifically targeting women (e.g, “Ladies’ Treats” combos, social media campaigns during key dates like Women’s Day, Mother’s Day).
- Age-responsive product development: Use stable performance across age ranges to introduce broad-appeal products with different branding and marketing (e.g. 26-35: Emphasize style, Energy, and eco-conscious packaging, 36-45: Highlight value, wellness, family convenience.
- Use data to set smarter targets: Consider adjusting KPIs slightly upward but realistically, and also, explore cross-training to build flexibility and resilience in operations (i.e, moving employees across departments when need be).
